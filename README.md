## Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to my Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! I built this React web application in order make the time complexities and steps of popular sorting algorithms tangible and comparable (and cool to watch). Below are the current supported algorithms:

 - Merge Sort - divide array into subarrays, sort, then merge back into whole array.
 - Quick Sort - rearrange elements around selected pivot element, repeat for smaller subarrays.
 - Bubble Sort - compare adjacent elements and swap them if necessary.
 - Insertion Sort - insert each element in correct order within whole array.
